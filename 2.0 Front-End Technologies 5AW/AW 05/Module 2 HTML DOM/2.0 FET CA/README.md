so its good to find a list with all the free apis on net and take ideas from there.

next.js you can create api very easy

about react native, i prefer ionic because with the same code you use it for web, ios, android and with capacitor thats in ionic you can export it for mac linux and windows... i prefer it too react native

## whatever course you do, build your own project after to practice at least one

I was wondering this myself..

I imagine it could simplify the lecturers workload. There are only two of them, and we're currently 234 students

I've been meaning to ask, what are your thoughts on the feedback from the FET CA?

We are 234 students paying 80k a year. They could afford to hire some more teachers

What feedback? all I got was “nice good work” nothing constructive at all

Thats quite constructive. What expectation did you have?

Well since I know I did somethings wrong I would expect to get a notice on that (edited)

Maria Mousavi — 03/11/2022
Mine did not go so well there is no key either, so I don’t really know how to fix my mistakes

Just made a post to the teachers about the lack of feedback in the CA. We'll keep you guys updated on how they respond.

Rickard Sandvik — 03/11/2022
I got feedback that a part didnt work, but I checked the code before I sent it in and now. Worked both times. (it was the contact being updated and console logged). So it was easy to check that it worked

Hans Christian Gustafsson — 03/11/2022
Did you try in a different browser? I got the same feedback but on a diff part. I could replicate the issue in edge..worked in firefox qnd chrome

Rickard Sandvik — 03/11/2022
Did not try that. Didn't even think about running it on different browsers

But who the hell use edge anyways

Very valid point

It was working it was just the wrong data, but it should be noticeable when other students get a notice on that I should too or?

Fatin Mahari — 04/11/2022
I have a good feedback on mine, the only thing i wish for that they could make a video or codes example on how they woud do it. So for the ones who have codes didnt work can compare their own to the teachers codes. We are still studying after all.

<!-- Georgia Bell — 07/11/2022
I got good feedback but a comment that only one image in the table was clickable.
Which was a little frustrating because the directions only specified "When you click an image", so I figured it was OK if it was just the first image that opened in a new window. I also was disappointed with the small amount of feedback, I spent a long time making sure everything worked and I was really curious about what their response would be to my coding style and how I chose to solve the problems. -->
