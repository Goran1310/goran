        <h1>Granny's Chocolate Chip Cookies</h1>
        <p>The trick to great cookies is getting the butter to the right
            consistency. Soft, but not melted. Cream the butter and two sugars,
            mix in the egg, vanilla, baking soda, water, and salt.
        </p>
        <p>Last of all, mix in the flour slowly, so there are no lumps or unmixed
            flour in your dough. Mix in the chocolate chips, then use two spoons
            to drop dough on an ungreased cookie sheet.
        </p>
        <p>Bake at 190&deg;c, and use your eyes and nose to know when they're
            done. Final step: enjoy!
        </p>
