          Barnaby The Bear’s my name, never call me Jack or James, I will sing
          my way to fame, Barnaby the Bear’s my name. Birds taught me to sing,
          when they took me to their king, first I had to fly, in the sky so
          high so high, so high so high so high, so — if you want to sing this
          way, think of what you’d like to say, add a tune and you will see,
          just how easy it can be. Treacle pudding, fish and chips, fizzy drinks
          and liquorice, flowers, rivers, sand and sea, snowflakes and the stars
          are free.

          to settle down, Until tomorrow, I’ll just keep moving on.
