JSON is a modern text format for storing and transporting data.
The JSON object contains methods for parsing JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) and converting values to JSON. It can't be called or constructed.
Unlike most global objects, JSON is not a constructor. You cannot use it with a new operator or invoke the JSON object as a function. All properties and methods of JSON are static (just like the Math object).

In JavaScript, we can use the JSON.parse() and JSON.stringify() methods to manage it. The stringify() method is responsible for serialization, while the parse() method is responsible for deserialization.
